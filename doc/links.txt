===========
Build Links
===========

Bitten supports the ability to link between any wiki-enabled objects in Trac.

To link to a particular build, use the TracLink syntax ``build:N``
(where ``N`` is the number of the build).

Linking to a particular step of the build is also supported by adding an
anchor reference, like ``build:N#Test``. If the step ID contains spaces,
the link must be quoted: ``build:"N#My Step"``.
