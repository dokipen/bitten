Version 0.6
(?, from 0.6.x branch)
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/bitten/tags/0.6.0

 * Python 2.4 is now required.
 * Switch to using HTTP for communication between the build master and build
   slaves. This means the `build-master` executable is no longer needed or
   installed, the build simply runs in the scope of the Trac site.
 * Build recipes now need to include instructions for performing the checkout 
   from the version control repository. The slave no longer receives a snapshot
   archive of the code, but performs the checkout itself based on the 
   instructions in the build recipe.
 * Many fixes for compatibility with more recent versions of Trac, and Bitten
   now requires Trac 0.11.
 * Unicode (non-ascii) support for recipes and command-line input and output.
 * Improved authentication support in bitten-slave, including support for the
   popular AccountManager plugin.
 * New command-line execute() using Python subprocess module that in particular
   improves the situation for slaves executing commands on Windows.
 * Build logs are moved from database and into project log/bitten directory as
   text files.
 * Slave-only install now possible by running 'python setup-slave.py install'.
 * Fixes related to creating and deleting builds correctly, including database
   upgrade to avoid thread race conditions.
 * Some improvements to the Admin user interface for creating/editing
   configurations and platforms.
 * Attachment support for configurations and builds, including a new general
   <attach> command to use in recipes.
 * <hg:pull> command added.
 * Many fixes and improvements for pre-existing commands.
 * Improvements for coverage, lint and test summary display.


Version 0.5.3
(18 April 2006, from 0.5.x branch)
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/bitten/tags/0.5.3

 * Fix double-escaping of report summaries.
 * Fix build master error when build log contains no messages.


Version 0.5.2
(17 January 2006, from 0.5.x branch)
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/bitten/tags/0.5.2

 * Fixes the main navigation tab that was broken in 0.5.1.


Version 0.5.1
(10 January 2006, from 0.5.x branch)
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/bitten/tags/0.5.1

 * Fixes compatibility with Trac 0.9.3 release, as well as the current trunk.
   This also means that Bitten now longer works with versions of Trac earlier
   than 0.9.3.
 * Improves PostgreSQL compatibility.
 * Fixes encoding of non-ASCII characters in command output.
 * Fix for missing log output when using <java:ant> on Windows.


Version 0.5
(6 October 2005, from 0.5.x branch)
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/bitten/tags/0.5

 * BDB XML is no longer being used for report storage. Instead,
   collected metrics data is stored in the Trac database.
 * Snapshot archives created by the master are checked for integrity
   prior to their transmission to the slaves.
 * Improvements to the build status presentation in Trac.
 * Changes to the build recipe format. See the documentation on the web
   site for details.
 * New recipe commands: <sh:pipe>, <c:configure>, <c:cppunit>,
   <java:ant>, <java:junit>, and <x:transform>. Various improvements to
   the existing commands.
 * Recipe commands and command attributes in recipes can now reference
   slave configuration values.
 * The names of the master and slaves scripts have changed: `bittend`
   is now `bitten-master`, `bitten` is now `bitten-slave`.
 * The build master can now handle multiple Trac environments.
 * The build slave now by default removes any working directories when
   done.
 * Build configurations can now be completely deleted.
 * Build configurations can now have a minimum and maximum revision
   specified. Any revisions outside that range will not be built.
 * The build configuration editor now validates the supplied values.
 * Fix management of target platforms when running under mod_python.
 * Improved performance of the build log formatter that is responsible
   for linking file references in build logs to the repository browser.
 * Add paging to the build configuration view.
 * Fix compatibility with PySQLite2.
