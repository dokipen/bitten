"""Implements the scheduling of builds for a project.

This module provides the functionality for scheduling builds for a specific
Trac environment. It is used by both the build master and the web interface to
get the list of required builds (revisions not built yet).

Furthermore, the `BuildQueue` class is used by the build master to determine
the next pending build, and to match build slaves against configured target
platforms.
